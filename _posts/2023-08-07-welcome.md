You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it
and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in
many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`,
which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file
is updated[^1].

To add new posts[^2], simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that
follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the
necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get
an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

``` ruby
puts "Hello world"
```
